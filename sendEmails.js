`Dear HR,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my interest in a Nodejs Developer opportunity at your organization. With over 3 years and 2 months of experience building scalable and high-performance web applications, I specialize in Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Socket.IO.

In my current role at Masterwiz Technologies Pvt. Ltd., I have led full-cycle development‚Äîfrom database design and backend architecture to dynamic frontend interfaces‚Äîfor several production-grade platforms:

üîπ MyMaster11 ‚Äì A fantasy sports platform (Dream11-like) where I built RESTful APIs, real-time leaderboard updates with Socket.IO, integrated Redis caching, and implemented contest workflows with RabbitMQ. I also contributed to the admin dashboard using React.js for real-time data monitoring and control.

üîπ Sportswiz ‚Äì A real-time sports score and news platform built with Node.js, MySQL, React.js, and Redis, delivering live commentary and score updates with millisecond latency, optimized for thousands of concurrent users.

üîπ Opinion Trading ‚Äì An opinion-based trading app where I implemented second-wise real-time updates using Socket.IO and developed both backend transaction processing and frontend UI components in React.js for a seamless trading experience.

üîπ MyMaster11 SportsBuy ‚Äì An e-commerce platform for sports merchandise where I developed both the backend and the frontend (React.js) including product listings, payment gateway integration, admin features, and S3-based image management.

I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and building systems that are fast, scalable, and user-centric. I am well-versed in JWT authentication, microservices, CI/CD, cloud deployment (AWS), and modern frontend practices with React Hooks, Context API, Redux, and TailwindCSS.

Please find my resume attached for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team‚Äôs goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Amar Dutt Upadhyay
